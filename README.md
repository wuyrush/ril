# ril

Save tabs you want to read later to avoid millions of tabs opened in your browser.

## Installation

### Firefox/Chrome extension store
TODO

### Build from source

First we need to have Node and NPM installed. Recommended approach is via [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
command -v nvm
nvm install node

# start a new shell session, then run following:
nvm use node
```

Then we can build the extension

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wuyrush/ril ~/ril && cd ~/ril
npm install && npm run build
```
The build process will generate a directory containing the extension bundle at `~/ril/dist`.

Now we can add the extension to the browser(instructions for [FireFox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox) and [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest) to load extensions locally).

Enjoy!

## Use

* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> to save the active tab in your current browser window(aka the current tab you are browsing)
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> to open extension popup so that you can select, open, or search for saved tabs:
  * <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>&darr;</kbd> to navigate through saved tabs. Selected tab is highlighted
  * Type in search box to fuzzy-search saved tabs by title and URL
  * <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the selected tab. This removes the selected tab from saved tabs as well
  * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to remove the selected tab from saved tabs. This will not open the selected tab


## Updates

### 01/13/19

MVP!

### 01/06/19

Closed to MVP. Done implementation of extension popup logic(navigation in saved tabs, open selected tab, fuzzy search in saved tabs).

### 12/25/18

Done re-structuring backend logic - note WebExtension background scripts still don't play well with JS bundling tools like Webpack.

### 12/17/18

Mixed of JS code and jQuery made the extension hard to maintain in the long run, migrate the extension to React instead.

### 09/06/18
* Sync the changes of tabs saved to browser's sync storage area. Note this essentially exploits the extension sync storage area, which has strict 100KB space limit. Thus it can be the case where there exist tabs failed to make it to the sync storage area. As a consequence, the data persisted in cache and local storage layer in different browser instances will diverge.
* Refactors

### 08/24/18
* Select saved tab via `Tab` key(Reverse selection via `Shift+Tab`). Note not all keyboards have arrow keys;
* Open the selected tab via `Enter`;
* Remove the selected tab via `Ctrl+d`;
* Make the extension compatible with Google Chrome via `browser-polyfill`(with ugly UI stillðŸ™ƒ)
* Highlight selected save tab;
* Remove redundant UI widgets.

### 08/18/18
* Key bindings to display saved tabs(`Ctrl+Shift+y`) and save tabs(`Ctrl+y`);
* Cache saved tabs in background to avoid hitting storage layer directly too often when retrieving saved tabs; Otherwise the load time of popup page with saved tabs can be long(~1-2s);
* TODOs:
    1. ~~Make the addon compatible with Chrome;~~
    1. ~~Select the saved tab to open via arrow keys or Tab key;~~
    1. ~~When a saved tab is selected, its background color changes to highlight itself.~~
        1. ~~The highlighting color MUST not reduce the readability of the summary and link of the tab.~~
    1. If the saved tab is still open, focus on that opened tab instead of opening a new one.

Plues refactors to make the caching strategy work.

### 08/12/18
* MVP supporting core functionality without any key binding supports.
* TODOs:
    1. ~~Key binding to a)trigger the extension, b)select saved tab and open it and c)remove selected tab;~~
    1. Fuzzy-search across saved tabs;
    1. Option page for extension configuration;
    1. Sync saved tabs across browser instance where user logs in;
    1. Better UI design.
